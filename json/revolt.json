The regulars led the van, the militia brought up the rear, whilst the Marons lined the wood to the right and left, to prevent ambuscades.  The rebels collected behind their fortification, made shew of a resolution to defend their post, and fired incessantly at their opponents, though with no other injury than wounding one soldier.  The officer? who commanded the detachment, advanced with the utmost intrepidity, ordering his men to reserve their fire, till they had reached the breast-work; at which time, they poured in such a volley, that several of the rebels immediately fell, and the rest ran as fast as they could up the hill. ? Having gained a lodgment, the troops declined a pursuit, and carelessly entered the huts, where they sat down to refresh themselves with some provisions, of which they found a large store; the rebels, perceiving this, discharged several random shot from the hill above them, which passed through the huts, and had very near been fatal to some of the officers: the Marons, upon this, penetrated the wood at the foot of the hill, and ascending it on the opposite side, and spreading themselves, suddenly assaulted the rebels in flank, who were instantly toured, and a great number killed, or taken prisoners.&quot; --Edward Long, History of Jamaica (1774) <br \/><br \/> Kingston Executions: &quot;Last Monday two more of the Negroes, concerned in the late Conspiracy, named Scipio and Harry, were executed at Spring Path; and last Thursday another Negroe, named Cuffee, likewise concerned, was executed at the same Place.
